# TinyML-AI-RobotArm
Smart Industrial Robotics with TinyML &amp; GenAI

**TinyML-AI-RobotArm** is an innovative project that leverages **Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to create an autonomous **6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF)** robotic arm capable of performing complex tasks in real-time. The project focuses on running lightweight AI models on low-power microcontrollers like the **Arduino TinyML Kit**, allowing the robot to process data locally and make decisions without requiring constant cloud connectivity.

Key features include **object detection and classification** using a camera module, powered by a TinyML model running directly on the Arduino. The robotic arm can recognize objects and adjust its actions dynamically, making it ideal for environments where latency and connectivity are concerns. Additionally, the project integrates **Google Cloud AI** services such as **AutoML** and **Vertex AI** to offload more computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, enabling continuous learning and optimization.

Another highlight is the integration of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** via **Googleâ€™s Natural Language API**, which allows users to interact with the robot using voice commands. This makes it suitable for applications in **smart factories**, **research labs**, and **educational environments**, where human-robot collaboration is essential.

With a focus on edge computing, **TinyML-AI-RobotArm** demonstrates the future potential of **Industry 4.0** and beyond, where AI-powered systems perform autonomous tasks while learning and adapting in real time. The project showcases how combining **TinyML**, **AI**, and **cloud services** can enhance robotic automation while keeping it accessible and cost-effective.
